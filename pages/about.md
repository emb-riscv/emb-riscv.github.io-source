## The project

After adding support for the RISC-V architecture in the GNU MCU Eclipse projects, and especially after writing the RISC-V project templates, it was clear that the current RISC-V devices are intended for running Unix-like operating and not bare metal applications.

The **Embedded RISC-V** project was created to explore the possibilities of bringing the RISC-V instruction set into the embedded world.

Some time ago, while watching a TV documentary about Porsche, I heard this line and I liked it. If this is indeed one of Porsche mottos, then thank you Porsche for it (and for the beautiful designs). (English: _"Perfect is not good enough"_)
