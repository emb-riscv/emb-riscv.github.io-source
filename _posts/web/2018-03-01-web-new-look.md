With the preliminary specs of the **RISC-V Microcontroller Profile** already available, it was time for the project to get a new web site.

## The GitHub Pages web site

Since [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) is the GitHub solution for providing documentation sites, and this service makes the sites available in the `github.io` domain, it was considered acceptable to use it for the project web site.

GitHub Pages uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to generate static web sites, and the most convenient input format for Jekyll is [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), so the entire web site is written in markdown.

The web site has two dedicated projects:

* [emb-riscv.github.io](https://github.com/emb-riscv/emb-riscv.github.io) - the Embedded RISC-V web static site
* [emb-riscv.github.io-source](https://github.com/emb-riscv/emb-riscv.github.io-source) - the complete Jekyll source for the Embedded RISC-V web

The first one stores the actual static pages of the Web site and the second stores the Jekyll source files for generating the Web site.
